Current work status of randomizer, so far basic list and *.prof to put it into.

Go under:

C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\LocalLow\Stunlock Studios\VRising\ConsoleProfile

in file DefaultProfile should have one that it is going to run after restart:

open that *.prof

copy below contents of ./misc/DESKTOP-asdf.prof under your ConsoleProfile default

==============================================================================

The config should load after you boot your game (check console for the profile name and amount of aliases (should be alot))


Run private brutal server (just set lvl to 100) with some fun settings,

Adminauth after you join, wake from your grave, type in console ready
 
- place castle hearth and Altar of Recollection - remove all blood skills

Type gear, afterwards if you want to go for boss fight type goboss. If you die, instead type repeat.

After some bosses you will get next gear to fight, but progression should be more or less -3 lvls

=============================================================================

So basically you get gear and tp to another bosses with "random" gear and so on or so forth.

TODO:

1) program every piece of armour set (can try to use giveset)

2) program progression for every boss encounter

3) add shortcuts with Console.Bind

4) add python randomizer script

    a) generate prof file contents
    
    b) give commands that can be put in console without need to reload .prof

5) add python twitch layout (ChromaKeying).

6) make a video about it

=============================================================================
